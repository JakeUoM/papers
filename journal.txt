Title:
Model-Measurements intercomparison of secondary organic aerosol


Introdution:
In this paper we present measurements of aerosol particles made over forests in west Africa.
Chemical composition and mass concentrations were measured using AMS (Allen et al 2004).
Smith et al 2007 made measurements in this regio, and while they were great, we need more in order to answers they were unable to address.

Simulations:
We present here simulations of aerosol particle formation, using a chamber model.
